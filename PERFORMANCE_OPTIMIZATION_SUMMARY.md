## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Optimization:
```sql
-- Example of created indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_trucks_brand_price ON trucks(brand, price);
CREATE INDEX idx_trucks_year_mileage ON trucks(year, mileage);
CREATE INDEX idx_cars_fuel_type ON cars(fuel_type);
-- ... 30+ more indexes
```

### Image Optimization:
```javascript
// Responsive image component
<picture>
  <source srcSet="/images/optimized/hero_small.avif" media="(max-width: 400px)" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcSet="/images/optimized/hero_medium.webp" media="(max-width: 800px)" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="/images/optimized/hero_medium.webp" alt="Hero" loading="lazy" />
</picture>
```

### Code Splitting:
```javascript
// Lazy loading with suspense
const LazyAIAssistant = withLazyLoading(
  React.lazy(() => import('./AIAssistant')),
  "Loading AI Assistant..."
);
```

### CDN Configuration:
```javascript
// Optimized image URLs with CDN
const imageUrl = getOptimizedImageUrl('/images/hero.jpg', {
  width: 800,
  quality: 85,
  format: 'webp'
});
```
