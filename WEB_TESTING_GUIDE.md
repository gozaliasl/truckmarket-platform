## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If pages don't load:

1. **Check servers are running:**
   ```bash
   # Backend should be on port 5001
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/health

   # Frontend should be on port 3000
   # Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
   ```

2. **Check for errors in browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Look at Console tab for errors
   - Look at Network tab for failed API calls

3. **Restart servers if needed:**
   ```bash
   # Stop all processes
   pkill -9 -f "node server/index.js"
   pkill -9 -f "react-scripts"

   # Restart backend
   cd /Users/gozalig1/Documents/truckplatfourm
   node server/index.js &

   # Restart frontend
   cd client && PORT=3000 npm start
   ```

### If API calls fail (CORS errors):

The backend should already have CORS enabled, but if you see CORS errors:
- Check server logs
- Verify server is running on port 5001
- Check browser console for specific error messages
