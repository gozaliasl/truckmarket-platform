## 📋 Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

Before pushing, you need to create the repository on GitHub:

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `truckmarket-platform`
3. **Description**: `Full-featured truck marketplace platform with user authentication, listings management, and subscription system`
4. **Visibility**: Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Do **NOT** check any of these:
   - ❌ Add a README file
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license
   
   (We already have these in our code!)

6. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Get Your Personal Access Token

Since you'll need to authenticate, create a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Note**: `TruckMarket Platform`
3. **Expiration**: Choose duration (90 days recommended)
4. **Select scopes**: Check `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"** at the bottom
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** - You won't see it again!
7. Save it somewhere safe (you'll use it as your password)

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run this command:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**When prompted**:
- **Username**: `gozaliasl`
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)
