## 🛠️ Managing the Platform

### Stop the servers
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal(s) where they're running

### Restart backend only
```bash
node server/index.js
```

### Restart frontend only
```bash
cd client && npm start
```

### Restart both (from root)
```bash
# In one terminal
node server/index.js

# In another terminal
cd client && npm start
```

### Or use the quick start script
```bash
./start.sh
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend not loading?
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/health`
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### No trucks showing?
1. Check database: `sqlite3 server/trucks.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trucks;"`
2. Should show: `8`
3. If 0, reseed: `node server/seed.js`
4. Restart backend server

### Port already in use?
- Frontend (3000): Kill process using port 3000
- Backend (5001): Kill process using port 5001
- Or change ports in configuration files
