I. GENERAL TERMS (YLEISET EHDOT)
§1 Scope of Application / Soveltamisala
These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern all access to and use of the Truck & Auto Market platform and services (the “Platform”) operated by Truck & Auto Market Oy (“Company”, “we”, “us”).
By accessing, browsing, registering, or otherwise using the Platform, each visitor or registered user (“User”) accepts these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.
The Platform provides technical infrastructure for listing, searching, and promoting vehicles (including trucks, cars, vans, motorhomes, motorcycles, and industrial machinery). The Company is not a party to contracts between sellers and buyers unless expressly stated.
§2 Definitions / Määritelmät
“Platform” – websites, apps, APIs, and systems run by the Company.
“User” – any natural or legal person using the Platform.
“Dealer” – a business or professional seller with a verified account.
“Content” – any data, text, images, videos, listings, messages uploaded or transmitted via the Platform.
“Contract” – the legal relationship between a User and the Company formed under these Terms.
§3 Registration, Account & Contract Formation / Rekisteröinti, tili ja sopimuksen syntyminen
Some features require registration. The User must provide accurate, current, and complete information and keep it updated.
Upon submission of the registration form, a contract for Platform use is formed when we confirm or grant access credentials. We may refuse registration at our discretion, subject to applicable law.
Users must safeguard credentials and are responsible for all activities under their accounts unless promptly notified misuse was beyond their control.
§4 Platform Role & No Agency / Alustan rooli
The Company provides a marketplace infrastructure. We do not own or inspect listed vehicles and do not act as seller, broker, or agent in transactions between Users, unless explicitly specified for separate services.
Contracts for the sale or lease of vehicles are concluded and performed solely between Users (e.g., Dealer and buyer).
§5 Acceptable Use / Hyväksyttävä käyttö
Users shall not: (i) post misleading or deceptive content; (ii) infringe intellectual property or privacy rights; (iii) upload malware; (iv) scrape or overload systems; (v) circumvent fees or ranking; (vi) misuse messaging for spam or harassment.
We may moderate, remove, delay publication, restrict, suspend, or terminate accounts, taking into account the User’s legitimate interests, where we identify or reasonably suspect violations.
§6 Availability & Maintenance / Käytettävyys ja huolto
We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted operation. Temporary disruptions may occur due to maintenance, capacity, security measures, or external factors.
In case of service degradation, we will act reasonably to restore operations while considering Users’ interests.
§7 Content Rights & License / Sisältöoikeudet ja lisenssi
Users grant the Company a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, cache, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, translate, and technically modify Content as necessary to provide, market, and improve the Platform.
Users warrant they own rights or have permissions for Content, including images and VINs, and that Content is lawful and accurate.
§8 Consumer Information & Withdrawal / Kuluttajainformaatio ja peruutus
Where a consumer (as defined by Finnish law) purchases a paid Platform service (e.g., listing package), the consumer may have a 14-day right of withdrawal for distance contracts unless services are fully performed during the withdrawal period with explicit consent.
Instructions and a model withdrawal form are provided in Annex A.
§9 Liability & Warranty / Vastuu ja takuu
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties. We are liable only for damages caused by intent or gross negligence and for death or personal injury. For other breaches, liability is limited to foreseeable direct damages.
We do not guarantee accuracy or availability of third-party listings.
§10 Changes to Terms / Ehtojen muutokset
We may amend these Terms to reflect legal, technical, or business changes. Updated Terms will be posted with an effective date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

§15 Ranking, Sorting & Promotion / Järjestys, lajittelu ja promootio
Default ranking considers relevance to the search query, User behavior, vehicle attributes (e.g., age, mileage, price), geography, completeness and quality of listing, and policy compliance.

Subject to a separate API agreement, Dealers may use APIs to synchronize inventory and analytics. We may impose authentication, quotas, and rate limits to protect the Platform.
We may throttle or suspend API access in the event of abuse, security risk, or system integrity concerns.
§18 Moderation, Removal & Suspension / Moderointi, poisto ja keskeytys
We may remove or delay listings or suspend Dealer accounts for legal violations, repeated policy breaches, non-payment, fraudulent activity, or risk to Platform integrity.
We consider Dealer’s legitimate interests and will notify where legally required.
§19 Warranty & Indemnity / Takuu ja vahingonkorvausvelvollisuus

We may adapt ad formats technically (size/format) for delivery. Substantive changes require advertiser consent.
§23 Delivery, Metrics & Make-Good / Toimitus, mittarit ja kompensaatio
We deliver ads during the agreed period and target metrics (impressions, clicks) where applicable. If delivery falls short, we may extend the campaign (make-good) or credit the shortfall proportionally.
Exact performance is not guaranteed due to external factors.
